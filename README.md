# React ðŸ™Œ Parcel

The most minimalistic React starter code using [Parcel](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel).

## Getting started

1. Install with yarn or npm:

`yarn` or `npm install`

2. Bundle and start development server:

`yarn start` or `npm run start`

3. It will tell you "Server running at http://localhost:1234". Go to this address in your browser.

4. Open `index.js` and change "Hello, world!" to something different. The change shows in your browser immediately!

5. Happy hacking!

## How does it work?

Parcel does the heavy lifting internally. [Learn more about Parcel](https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html). 

The only necessary config is for [babel](https://babeljs.io/), as we want to compile ES6 & JSX to browser-compatible JavaScript code. That's why there's the `.babelrc` file and the corresponding preset `babel-preset-react` as dev-dependency in the `package.json` file.

## Beyond the Starter Code

### Support ES6, ES7 etc. using babel

If you want to add support for new ES specifications, you'd look up the appropriate babel preset or plugin. A popular example would be to add the ["env" preset](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-env/), by running `yarn add --dev babel-preset-env` and adding `env` in your `.babelrc` file's preset array.

To add plugins, you will have to install the plugin, e.g. [babel-plugin-transform-class-properties](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-class-properties/) to define your component's state outside of the component's constructor. After installing `yarn add --dev babel-plugin-transform-class-properties`, you have to modify your `.babelrc` again and add a new key `plugins`, which holds an array of plugins. Your .babelrc file will look like this:

```
{
  "presets": ["env", "react"],
  "plugins": ["transform-class-properties"]
}

```

### TODO

*TODO:* In this section we will discuss where you could take this simple starter code.

Possible topics:
- how to add testing
- using PostCSS and PostHTML
- using parcel's built-in code splitting
- ...

**Contributions welcome!**

## Other React Starter-Projects
- Also /w parcel, but using more config: [react-parcel-example](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/react-parcel-example)
- Famous CRA, using webpack internally: [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
