# React ðŸ™Œ Parcel

The most minimalistic React starter code using [Parcel](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel).

## Getting started

1. Install with yarn or npm:

`yarn` or `npm install`

2. Bundle and start development server:

`yarn start` or `npm run start`

3. It will tell you "Server running at http://localhost:1234". Go to this address in your browser.

4. Open `index.js` and change "Hello, world!" to something different. The change shows in your browser immediately!

5. Happy hacking!

## Beyond the Starter Code

*TODO:* In this section we will discuss where you could take this simple starter code.

Possible topics:
- using PostCSS and PostHTML
- using parcel's built-in code splitting
- ...

**Contributions welcome!**
